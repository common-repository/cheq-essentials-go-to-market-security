Invalid traffic (27% of direct and organic traffic on average in 2022) refers to any non-human or fraudulent activity, such as bots, click farms, and other forms of automated traffic. This can not only damage your site's reputation but also result in lost revenue, slow performance, and skewed data that damage your decision-making.
